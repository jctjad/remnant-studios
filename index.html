            <h2>Anti-AutoClicker</h2>
            <p>
                This is a software algorithm designed to identify and prevent illegal “auto-click” software, which automatically clicks for the user at inhuman high speeds. This is an exploit for many games, because a fast clicking speed can provide an unfair advantage for users who auto-click over users who click manually. 
                On release, this software immediately became the most popular anti-autoclicker on the market. It is now implemented in a large number of games and interacts with hundreds of daily users. 
                The main challenge in making this algorithm was finding a way to identify manual clicking compared to auto-clicking. Over time, we hope to improve the software’s ability to distinguish between the two, and convert to using a machine learning model.

            <h2>Alt-Detector (WIP)</h2>
            <p>
                Alternate account usage, which goes hand in hand with “smurfing,” is a major problem for competitive video game users. In fact, in an article about Valorant, the most popular first person shooter game worldwide, alternate account usage is the biggest problem for players of the game. Alternate accounts enable players to exploit and cheat inside the game without getting severely punished, they encourage toxicity and harassment, and they allow for smurfing, which ruins the experience for all members of the game.
                We are in the process of creating an alternate account detector to combat these alternate accounts, which are considered illegal by most games due to their negative implications. Our detector uses machine learning to identify alternate accounts using similar methods as the Google Search algorithm. We are implementing the detector in the form of a Discord Bot, which allows users to “check” if an account is a main or alternate account in real-time. The detector stores a database of each user checked, so the more the bot is used, the better it becomes. We hope our detector will help to combat the overwhelming problem of exploiting, toxicity, and smurfing in competitive online gaming.
